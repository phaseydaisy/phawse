      <p class="word-type">exclamation</p>
      <p class="definition">An expression used to show disapproval, disbelief, or mild annoyance, often in a playful or dramatic manner. It's a sound made by exhaling sharply through the nose, typically accompanied by crossed arms or turning away. The utterance conveys feelings ranging from genuine frustration to mock indignation, and is commonly used to express disagreement without starting an argument. Despite its seemingly grumpy nature, 'hmph' is often employed in a lighthearted, almost endearing way, especially when someone wants to maintain a façade of being upset while secretly being amused.</p>
